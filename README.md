# File Compression Repository 📦

This repository is dedicated to exploring and implementing various **file compression algorithms**. Each folder in this repository represents a specific algorithm or approach, complete with source code, documentation, and practical examples.

---

## 🔍 Purpose

The goal is to study how different compression algorithms work under the hood and to share working C implementations with detailed explanations and usage examples. This is a learning-oriented project aimed at building a deeper understanding of how file compression works.

## 📁 Current Modules

### [`LZW/`](./LZW)

The first implemented algorithm is **Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW)**. Inside this folder:

- ✅ A working C implementation.
- ✅ Dictionary-based compression logic.
- ✅ Console-based interaction for compressing custom strings.
- ✅ Comparison between original and compressed sizes.

> 📄 Check out the [`README.md`](./LZW/README.md) inside the folder for more details.

## 🔧 Requirements

- GCC or any standard C compiler.
- Basic understanding of C programming and terminal commands.

---

## 🛠️ Upcoming Plans

Planned additions:
- Huffman Coding
- Run-Length Encoding (RLE)
- DEFLATE (if manageable)
- Performance benchmarks
